### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Create new Person/Event/Vendor/Venue Feature

In EventWise, users are able to create a new person, event, vendor and venue instance and are stored in storage.

#### Create a new Person

The feature `add` creates a new `Person` instance. Details that must be provided includes `Name`, `Phone` and `Email`.

##### Implementation

The sequence diagram for the `add` command is given below.

<img src="images/CreateSequenceDiagram.png" width="550" />

1. The `LogicManager` receives an input string to execute. For example, using the sequence diagram above,
it receives `add n/Tom p/912 e/t@nus.com`
2. The `LogicManager` then sends the input string to `AddressBookParser`
3. The `AddressBookParser` then validate the input string and create a new `AddCommandParser` instance
4. The `AddressBookParser` then parse the name, phone and email of the user input. In this example, `n/Tom p/912 e/t@nus.com` is the parameter parsed to `AddCommandParser`
5. The `AddCommandParser` then creates a new Person instance and creates a `AddCommand` object with the newly created `Person` object
6. This `AddCommand` is then passed back to `LogicManager`
7. The `LogicManager` then calls the `execute` method in `AddCommand`
8. The `AddCommand` then interacts with the `Model` instance to add the `Person` object to storage
9. After adding the `Person` object, the `Model` update the filtered person list which updates the GUI to display the newly created `Person` object
10. Lastly, The `AddCommand` creates a `CommandResult` instance and return it to `LogicManager` to display success message

#### Create a new Event

The feature `event` creates a new `Event` instance. Details that must be provided includes `Name`, `Description`, `FromDate` and `ToDate` and an optional `Note`.

##### Implementation

The sequence diagram for the `event` command is similar to the `add` command. Hence, we will be referring to the sequence diagram of the `add` command.
The difference between the `add` and `event` implementation is:
1. An example of the user input for `event` is `event n/FSC 2023 d/Freshman Social Camp 2023 from/11-12-2023 to/13-12-2023 no/Food and Drinks provided`
2. Instead of `AddCommandParser`, it will be replaced with `CreateEventCommandParser`
3. Instead of `AddCommand`, it will be replaced with `CreateEventCommand`
4. Instead of parsing the name, phone and email of the user input, the name, description, from date, to date and the optional note will be parsed.
5. Instead of creating and adding the `Person` object, it will be replaced with `Event` object
6. Instead of the `Model` updating the filtered person list, the `Model` updates the filtered event list instead

#### Create a new Vendor

The feature `vendor` creates a new `Vendor` instance. Details that must be provided includes `Name`, `Phone`, `Email`.

##### Implementation

The sequence diagram for the `vendor` command is similar to the `add` command. Hence, we will be referring to the sequence diagram of the `add` command.
The difference between the `add` and `vendor` implementation is:
1. An example of the user input for `vendor` is `vendor n/SUN Catering p/64226800 e/catering@sun.com`
2. Instead of `AddCommandParser`, it will be replaced with `CreateVendorCommandParser`
3. Instead of `AddCommand`, it will be replaced with `CreateVendorCommand`
4. In this case, the details that will be parsed from the user input will be the same, which is the name, phone and email
5. Instead of creating and adding the `Person` object, it will be replaced with `Vendor` object
6. Instead of the `Model` updating the filtered person list, the `Model` updates the filtered vendor list instead

#### Create a new Venue

The feature `venue` creates a new `Venue` instance. Details that must be provided includes `Name`, `Address`, `Capacity`.

##### Implementation

The sequence diagram for the `venue` command is similar to the `add` command. Hence, we will be referring to the sequence diagram of the `add` command.
The difference between the `add` and `venue` implementation is:
1. An example of the user input for `venue` is `venue n/MPSH 1 a/Multipurpose Sports Hall 1, Sports and Recreation Centre, 119077 c/500`
2. Instead of `AddCommandParser`, it will be replaced with `CreateVenueCommandParser`
3. Instead of `AddCommand`, it will be replaced with `CreateVenueCommand`
4. Instead of parsing the name, phone and email of the user input, the name, address and capacity will be parsed.
5. Instead of creating and adding the `Person` object, it will be replaced with `Venue` object
6. Instead of the `Model` updating the filtered person list, the `Model` updates the filtered venue list instead

### View specific event Feature

Viewing a specific event is a feature that uses the command `viewEvent eid/EVENT_ID`.

The format for this command can be seen [here](./UserGuide.md#displaying-details-for-an-event-viewevent).

It is used to view detailed information relating to an existing `Event` in EventWise such as the event's `Venue` information, a list of `Person` objects and a list of `Vendor` objects that are part of the specific event.

#### Implementation

`LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser` which creates an instance of a `ViewEventCommandParser` to parse user inputs. An instance of `ViewEventCommand` is created from parsing the user inputs, which is then executed by `LogicManager`. The `Event` instance is set as the event to be displayed in `Model`. `MainWindow` calls `Logic` to get the `Event` instance from `Model` after the `CommandResult` from executing the `ViewEventCommand` has been shown to the user.

### Add Event Details Feature

The command `addEventDetails eid/EVENT_ID [pid/INDEX] [vdr/VENDOR_ID] [vne/VENUE_ID]` allows the user to add event details such as venue, guests and vendors to a specified event in EventWise.

The format for this command can be seen [here](./UserGuide.md#adding-details-to-an-event-addeventdetails).

#### Implementation
![](./images/add-event-details/activity_diagram.png)

`LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser` which creates an instance of a `AddEventDetailsCommandParser` to parse user inputs.

The `AddEventDetailsCommandParser` parses the user input into
* `personIndexes` and `vendorIndexes` which are two `HashSet<Index>` objects storing multiple people or vendor indexes.
* `venueIndex` representing the venue index displayed in the Main List.

An instance of `AddEventDetailsCommand` is created from the parsed user inputs `personIndexes`, `vendorIndexes` and `venueIndex`, which is then executed by `LogicManager`.

The `Event` instance is set as the event to be displayed in `Model`. `MainWindow` calls `Logic` to get the `Event` instance from `Model` after the `CommandResult` from executing the `ViewEventCommand` has been shown to the user.

#### Remarks
In our Developer Guide, we have decided to split it into **three** smaller subfeatures to explain their command execution and implementation details.
1. Add Person to Event
2. Add Vendor to Event
3. Set Venue to Event

### Add Person to Event Subfeature

Adding a person to a specific event is a subfeature of the `addEventDetails` command which uses the `[pid/INDEX]` field. It can be repeated more than once to add multiple people.

#### Implementation
![Sequence Diagram for Add Person to Event](./images/add-event-details/AddPersonToEventSequenceDiagram.png)

* When the `AddEventDetailsCommand` is executed by `LogicManager`. The `AddEventDetailsCommand` instance calls the `Model` to get a list of events before making another call to get all person instances to be added to the event.

* `Model#getPersons(personIndexes)` will handle cases where the person index is invalid (less than 0 or more than number of persons)

* A new `Event` instance, `editedEvent` is created by `Model` and returned to the `AddEventDetailsCommand`. `AddEventDetailsCommand` will then call `Model#setEvent(eventToEdit, editedEvent)` to update the modified event instance.

* Finally, the `editedEvent` is set as the event to be displayed in `Model`.

### Add Vendor to Event Subfeature

Adding a vendor to a specific event is subfeature of the `addEventDetails` command which uses the `[vdr/VENDOR_ID]` field. It can be repeated more than once to add multiple people.

#### Implementation
![Sequence Diagram for Add Vendor to Event](./images/add-event-details/AddVendorToEventSequenceDiagram.png)

* When the `AddEventDetailsCommand` is executed by `LogicManager`. The `AddEventDetailsCommand` instance calls the `Model` to get a list of events before making another call to get all vendor instances to be added to the event.

* `Model#getVendors(vendorIndexes)` will handle cases where the vendor index is invalid (less than 0 or more than number of vendors)

* A new `Event` instance, `editedEvent` is created by `Model` and returned to the `AddEventDetailsCommand`. `AddEventDetailsCommand` will then call `Model#setEvent(eventToEdit, editedEvent)` to update the modified event instance.

* Finally, the `editedEvent` is set as the event to be displayed in `Model`.

### Set Venue to Event Subfeature

Setting a venue to a specific event is subfeature of the `addEventDetails` command which uses the `[vne/VENUE_ID]` field.

#### Implementation
![Sequence Diagram for Set Venue to Event](./images/add-event-details/SetVenueToEventSequenceDiagram.png)

* When the `AddEventDetailsCommand` is executed by `LogicManager`. The `AddEventDetailsCommand` instance calls the `Model` to get a list of events before making another call to get the venue instance to be set as the event's venue.

* `Model#getVenue(venueIndex)` will handle cases where the venue index is invalid (less than 0 or more than number of vendors).

* A new `Event` instance, `editedEvent` is created by `Model` and returned to the `AddEventDetailsCommand`. `AddEventDetailsCommand` will then call `Model#setEvent(eventToEdit, editedEvent)` to update the modified event instance.

* Finally, the `editedEvent` is set as the event to be displayed in `Model`.

### Remove Person from Event Feature

Removing a person from an event is a feature that uses the command `removePerson eid/EVENT_ID pid/PERSON_ID`.

The format for this command can be seen [here](./UserGuide.md#removing-a-person-from-an-event-removeperson).

#### Implementation
The following activity diagram shows how the `removePerson` command works when given valid parameters or invalid parameters (`EVENT_ID` or `PERSON_ID`) are given.

![Activity Diagram](./images/remove-person/activity_diagram.png)

The sequence diagram for the `removePerson` command is given below.

![Sequence Diagram](./images/remove-person/sequence_diagram.png)

`LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser` which creates an instance of a `RemoveVendorCommandParser` to parse user inputs. An instance of `RemovePersonCommand` is created from parsing the user inputs, which is then executed by `LogicManager`.

When `RemovePersonCommand#execute()` is called, `RemovePersonCommand` calls `Model` to get the `Event` instance to edit. `RemovePersonCommand` then calls the `Event` instance to remove the person from the event by passing `personIndex`.
Finally, `RemovePersonCommand` calls the `Model` instance to update the edited `Event` instance before creating a `CommandResult` to be shown to the user.

### Remove Vendor from Event Feature

Removing a vendor from an event is a feature that uses the command `removeVendor eid/EVENT_ID vdr/VENDOR_ID`.

The format for this command can be seen [here](./UserGuide.md#removing-a-vendor-from-an-event-removevendor).

#### Implementation
The sequence diagram for the `removeVendor` command is given below.

![Sequence Diagram](./images/remove-vendor/sequence_diagram.png)

`LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser` which creates an instance of a `RemoveVendorCommandParser` to parse user inputs. An instance of `RemoveVendorCommand` is created from parsing the user inputs, which is then executed by `LogicManager`.

When `RemoveVendorCommand#execute()` is called, `RemoveVendorCommand` calls `Model` to get the `Event` instance to edit. `RemoveVendorCommand` then calls the `Event` instance to remove the vendor from the event by passing `vendorIndex`.
Finally, `RemoveVendorCommand` calls the `Model` instance to update the edited `Event` instance before creating a `CommandResult` to be shown to the user.

### Find event Feature

Finding events by name is a feature that uses the command `findEvent KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`.

The format for this command can be seen [here](./UserGuide.md#locating-events-by-name-findevent).

#### Implementation

`LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser` which creates an instance of a `FindEventCommandParser` to parse user inputs into an array of keywords. An instance of `FindEventCommand` is created, which is then executed by `LogicManager`.

All `Event` instances whose names match the keywords are then listed.

### RSVP feature

In EventWise, users are able to set the RSVP status to indicate their attendance after being added to an event. The feature `rsvp` sets a creates a new `Rsvp` instance. In each `rsvp` instance, it stores the `Person` object, the `Event` object as well as the `RSVP_Status`.

#### Implementation

The following activity diagram shows how the `rsvp` command works when given valid parameters or invalid parameters (`EVENT_ID`, `PERSON_ID` or `RSVP_STATUS`) are given.

<img src="images/RsvpActivityDiagram.png" width="550" />

The sequence diagram for the `rsvp` command is given below.

<img src="images/RSVPSequenceDiagram.png" width="550" />

1. The `LogicManager` receives an input string to execute. For example, using the sequence diagram above,
   it receives `rsvp eid/1 pid/1 s/CC`
2. The `LogicManager` then sends the input string to `AddressBookParser`
3. The `AddressBookParser` then validate the input string and create a new `RsvpCommandParser` instance
4. The `AddressBookParser` then parse the `Event ID`, `Person ID` and `RSVP_Status` of the user input. In this example, `eid/1 pid/1 s/CC` is the parameter parsed to `RsvpCommandParser`
5. The `RsvpCommandParser` then creates a `RSVPCommand` instance with the `Index` value of the `Event_ID` and `Person_ID`. It also provided the `RsvpStatus` object
6. This `RsvpCommand` is then passed back to `LogicManager`
7. The `LogicManager` then calls the `execute` method in `RsvpCommand`
8. The `RsvpCommand` then interacts with the `Model` instance to create a new `Rsvp` object.
9. The `RsvpCommand` then check whether the `Rsvp` object is valid by checking if the `Person` is attending the `Event`
10. The `RsvpCommand` then interacts with the `Model` instance again to add the `Rsvp` object to storage
11. After adding the `Rsvp` object, the `Model` update the filtered RSVP list which updates the GUI to display the newly created `Rsvp` object
12. Lastly, The `RsvpCommand` creates a `CommandResult` instance and return it to `LogicManager` to display success message

### Clear all Data/Person/Event/Vendor/Venue Feature

In EventWise, users are able to delete all entries in storage and also have the option to delete all entries of `Person`, `Event`, `Vendor`, or `Venue`

#### Clear all Data

The feature `clear` clears all entries in storage

##### Implementation

1. The `LogicManager` receives an input string, `clear` to execute
2. The `LogicManager` then sends the input string to `AddressBookParser`
3. The `AddressBookParser` then validate the input string and create a new `ClearCommand` instance
4. The `LogicManager` then calls the `execute` method in `ClearCommand`
5. The `ClearCommand` then interacts with the `Model` instance to create a new empty storage.
6. Lastly, The `ClearCommand` creates a `CommandResult` instance and return it to `LogicManager` to display success message

#### Clear all Persons

The feature `clearGuests` clears all `Person` entries in storage

##### Implementation

The implementation of `clearGuests` is similar to `clear`. The difference are:
1. The user input string is `clearGuests` instead of `clear`
2. The `AddressBookParser` creates a new `ClearGuestsCommand` instead of `ClearCommand`
3. The `ClearGuestsComand` interacts with the `Model` instance to create a new and empty `ArrayList` of type `Person`

#### Clear all Events

The feature `clearEvents` clears all `Event` entries in storage

##### Implementation

The implementation of `clearEvents` is similar to `clear`. The difference are:
1. The user input string is `clearEvents` instead of `clear`
2. The `AddressBookParser` creates a new `ClearEventsCommand` instead of `ClearCommand`
3. The `ClearEventsCommand` interacts with the `Model` instance to create a new and empty `ArrayList` of type `Event`

#### Clear all Vendors

The feature `clearVendors` clears all `Vendor` entries in storage

##### Implementation

The implementation of `clearVendors` is similar to `clear`. The difference are:
1. The user input string is `clearVendors` instead of `clear`
2. The `AddressBookParser` creates a new `ClearVendorsCommand` instead of `ClearCommand`
3. The `ClearVendorsCommand` interacts with the `Model` instance to create a new and empty `ArrayList` of type `Vendor`

#### Clear all Venues

The feature `clearVenues` clears all `Venue` entries in storage

##### Implementation

The implementation of `clearVenues` is similar to `clear`. The difference are:
1. The user input string is `clearVenues` instead of `clear`
2. The `AddressBookParser` creates a new `ClearVenuesCommand` instead of `ClearCommand`
3. The `ClearVenuesCommand` interacts with the `Model` instance to create a new and empty `ArrayList` of type `Venue`

    2. Expected Behaviour: The app will create this file with prepopulated events, persons, vendors and venues.

2. Dealing with corrupted data files
    1. To simulate a corrupted file, edit the `data/addressbook.json` file such that it does not follow the proper json format before running the app.
    2. Expected Behaviour: The app will not list any events, persons, vendors or venues. It will clear all events, persons, vendors or venues in `data/addressbook.json` when a user enters a valid command.


## Planned Enhancements
Given below are the fixes proposed to add in the near future.

### 1. Deal with text-wrapping and truncation in UI
* The current implementation of the truncates text relative to the window size, resulting in users being unable to view lengthy text even with text wrapping enabled in the UI.
* Proposed solution: To update DisplayableItemCard, PersonCard and VendorCard to have dynamic heights, so when text is wrapped, the Card components expands in height so text is no longer truncated.

### 2. Make the UI responsive to smaller window sizes
* The current UI does not scale to a smaller window size, resulting in the Person List being cut off from the window if the window width is too small.
* Proposed solution: Set a minimum width for MainWindow, Person
ListPanel and VendorListPanel.
